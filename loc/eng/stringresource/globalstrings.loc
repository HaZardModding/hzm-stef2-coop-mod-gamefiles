TwoThousand                                                         "Nearly two thousand years ago, the Attrexians began truly developing their independence on interstellar relations, and are now thriving in the system which houses their home planet and a few sister planets and trade stations."
HeartyRace                                                          "A hearty race, the Attrexians are boisterous and unrefined.

EducationPlays                                                      "Education plays a secondary role to family and work in Attrexian society, as well as the development of an advanced health care system built to deal with casualties of manual labor and the harsh living conditions associated with interstellar trade."
AttrexianLife                                                       "Attrexian life is built around the maintenance of their planet as well as the production of power for their numerous industrial projects. They have a resource heavy planet which produces many desirable goods for neighboring systems."
Hierarchy                                                           "The heirarchy of Attrexian society is a traditional council driven government with female members overseeing most of the trade and commercial decisions regarding interstellar relations.

AttrexianEnvironments                                               "Attrexian environments are built solely for function. Pieced together more for efficiency than form, their cities are always in a constant state of production. Vast ecological damage has impacted the hospitability of their planet in some areas."
AttrexianTechnological                                              "The Attrexian technological development is not up to par with other similarly evolved species"

Eschewing space travel, many Idryll stay within Attrexian space and act as technicians and engineers for the Attrexian government, which they have served under for several hundred years.  In Attrexian society, the Idryll are not recognized as equals but as vassals, who work for their Attrexian overseers."

The Idryll are regarded highly by several Federation institutions for their proficiency in several art forms including music, paintings, and architecture."
