//Texture Quality - lower is better - range per menu 0-2 - set to 5 if you want to inspect geometry of a level or better yet use: set r_lightmap 1
seta r_picmip "0"
//color depth of textures, affecting both the visual quality of the textures and the performance of the game - default 0 (auto)
seta r_texturebits "32"
//OpenGL extensions - results are very driver dependant - can result in higher frame rates and smoother gameplay - turn off if you have glitches - default 1
seta r_allowextensions "1"
//texture filtering improves appearance of textures, reduces the blurriness - but you may want to look into your driver settings and rather use them - default 0
seta r_anisotropicFiltering "1"
//MSAA (Multisample Anti-Aliasing) reduces the jagged edges, provides smoother edges - default 0
seta r_arb_multisample "1"
//reduce memory usage and potentially improve performance at the cost of texture quality - default 0

//dynamic lights like effect lights emitted by models (projectiles/flag) - default 0
seta r_dynamiclight "1"
//dynamic lights in the level - these are baked into the BSP, like brocken blinking lights - default 1
seta r_dynamiclightmaps "1"

//Simple Lighting Model - objects or surfaces beyond a certain distance use less detailed rendering - default 1000
seta r_light_simple_dist "5000"
//effect detail, higher is better but may cause some effects to disappear due to overload - default 1
seta cg_effectdetail "1.0"

//Controls the level of subdivision for curved surfaces, lower is visually better - default 4
seta r_subdivisions "1"

//Rounds image dimensions down to power of 2. - this is mostly not relevant for EF2 since it uses virtually only DDS-Texture files - default 1
//seta r_roundImagesDown 1

//near clipping plane is the closest distance at which objects are rendered. Objects closer than this distance will not be displayed - default 2
//i challange you to set it to 200 and see what happens

//Synchronous Clients: When enabled, client input and movement commands are processed in lockstep with the server. This means that client actions are only processed when the server updates, leading to a more deterministic but potentially less smooth gameplay experience. - default 0
//set g_syncronusClients 1

//pass commands through the game engine to a connected server. This is often utilized in the context of running dedicated servers or for specific network or server-related debugging. - default 1
