//Config files do not overflow the game console, so we don't have
//to be afraid to crash the server or kick clients by executing
//big code cunk. Config files are executed relaiable and are client
//managed. This saves us a lot of script code and time.

//How ever, the last command in a cfg file seems to be complete
//as in the value needs to be envoloped in "" or the command needs
//to be terminated with ; or a empty line needs to be added at the end
//so that the last command is properly send to console and not interrupted
//by the cfg file suddenly ending

//if that would be the case the next command is just beeing appeneded
//meaning it could construct a invalid command
