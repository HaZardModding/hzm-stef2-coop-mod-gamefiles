//Chrissstrahl - INFO
//As long as you have levels like coop_xx1, coop_xx2 and so on it is fine to use a seperate loc-file with the mapname like coop_xx1, coop_xx2.
//If you have a structure like coop_xx, coop_xx2 you need to set the loc-filename to what is defined at level, Example:
//
//env coop_paradiseIsland loading-M0-intro models/sky/sky_UI-stardome-ent.tik
//	level coop_paradiseIsland
//		sublevel coop_paradiseIsland		"Coop Paradise Island 1"
//		sublevel coop_paradiseIsland2		"Coop Paradise Island 2"
//LOC-FILENAME for all levels: coop_paradiseIsland, like in the ent-deck levels
